# CS180: Computer Vision & Computational Photography — Project Portfolio

This repository contains my project submissions for **CS180 (Computer Vision & Computational Photography)**.  
Each project is presented as a self-contained website with explanations, figures, and results.

The projects progress from **camera geometry and classical vision** to **3D neural representations** and **modern generative models**, emphasizing both conceptual understanding and implementation.
